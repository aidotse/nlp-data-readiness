# Introduction

At RISE, we often work in cooperation with other organizations with respect to applied research and business challenges 
that lend themselves to solutions based on natural language processing (NLP). The purpose of this document is to outline
and highlight issues related to data access, accessibility, and validity that may arise in such situations.



## Limitations

This document is concerned with data availability, accessibility, and validity for the purpose of natural language
processing. Thus, other modalities such as images, video, speech or sensor data are not covered.
