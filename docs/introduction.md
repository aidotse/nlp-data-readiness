# Introduction

At RISE, we often work in cooperation with other organizations with respect to applied research and business challenges 
that lend themselves to solutions based on natural language processing (NLP). The purpose of this document is to outline
and highlight issues related to data accessibility, validity, and utility that may arise in such situations.


## Scope

This document is concerned with data readiness in the context of natural language
processing. Thus, other modalities such as images, video, speech or sensor data are not covered. 

## How to use this document

The intention is for the NLP data readiness document to provide insights into the type of challenges one might 
encounter, with respect to data, when embarking on a project involving natural language processing. The document is focused
on asking the right questions rather than providing an explicit guide that covers all possible challenges in a project: 
such a guiding will inevitably vary with the specific task at hand. 

* [Data Readiness Levels](data-readiness-levels.md) introduces the notion of data readiness.
* [Project phases](project-phases.md) outlines the typical structure of a research or innovation project, and puts data readiness into context within that structure. 
* [Questions for guidance](questions-for-guidance.md) is the central part of the *NLP data readiness* document. Use the questions to understand the data readiness of your own project.
* [Resources](resources.md) is a collection of links to resources related to this document.
* [How to contribute](contribute.md) contains instructions for how to help us improve the document. Please, reach out with any questions, or suggestions!
